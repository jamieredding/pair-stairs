# Core

The [ScoringRule](src/main/java/dev/coldhands/pair/stairs/core/domain/ScoringRule.java) is the basis of the algorithm 
for determining how pair combinations are scored.

Currently, those in use are configured in the 
[ScoringRulesFactory](src/main/java/dev/coldhands/pair/stairs/core/usecases/pairstream/ScoringRulesFactory.java).
